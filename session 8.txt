1. Monolith Architecture: All FE, BE, servies are in one application/project/one codebase.
2. Microservices: A project is breaked in small small projects individually. Like UI is diff project, 
BE is also breaked in small small services/projects, Log project, authentication project, etc.  
Every project is running on diff ports.

Benefits:
1. Easy to test
2. If anything in UI needs to be deployed, then only UI project re-deployment needs to be done. Where also
in Monolith project, whole app needs to be redeployed
3. It helps to get separation of concern.
4. It helps to have different framework/tech stack in each services. Where as in Monolith, BE ll be in one tech stack, FE ll be one tech stack.

3. A shimmer UI is a version of the UI that doesn't contain actual content, but instead mimics the layout and shapes of the content that will eventually appear. 
It uses a gradient animation that creates a shimmering effect over the placeholders, giving the user a sense of motion and progress.

4. Js Statement => 
let a=10;
console.log(a),

if else, etc.

5. JS expression=> ternary opertaor, (a=10,console.log(a)), etc.

In jsx, in curly bracket, js expression can only work, not js Statement.
Thats why in {} in jsx, we cant use if else, but can use ternary operator.
