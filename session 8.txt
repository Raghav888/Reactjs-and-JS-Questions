1. Monolith Architecture: All FE, BE, servies are in one application/project/one codebase.
2. Microservices: A project is breaked in small small projects individually. Like UI is diff project, 
BE is also breaked in small small services/projects, Log project, authentication project, etc.  
Every project is running on diff ports.

Benefits:
1. Easy to test
2. If anything in UI needs to be deployed, then only UI project re-deployment needs to be done. Where also
in Monolith project, whole app needs to be redeployed
3. It helps to get separation of concern.
4. It helps to have different framework/tech stack in each services. Where as in Monolith, BE ll be in one tech stack, FE ll be one tech stack.
