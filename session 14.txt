1. We can multiple context but in redux we have single store.
2. But the store in redux will be deivided in slices ex: user, theme, cart, etc.
3. Redux flow=>   dispatch=> action=> reducer  => store/slice=> selector=> view
4. We cannot directly modify store, we can do it by dispatch and action only.
5. Selector=> it is used to read the redux store.
6. redux tooklit is lib for store purpose whereas, react-redux lib is used to make connect or act as bridge between react and redux toolkit.
7. Store is divided in Slice.
8. useSelector hook is used to suscribe to redux store. It is imported from react-redux.

useSelector(store=> store) // suscribes to whole store
useSelector(store=> store.cart)// suscribes to only cart slice
useSelector(store=> store.cart.items) // suscribes to only items state in cart slice. This is optimised way.
Should only suscribe to required things not to whole store. Or it will rerender component when anything in store is updated.
Important for interview question and optimization.
