1. From React Router DOM lib, we can also use createBroswerRoute() to create routing.

2. BroswerRouter: https://reactrouter.com/en/main/router-components/browser-router

3.  Clinet side rendering-> dynamic content, user activity based content, seo problem, slow load
 Server Side Rendering- CDN based, faster load, static content, better seo

 We should combination of both in project.

 4. Client Side Routing- Routing handled on Client side, by loading diff component. (We do these)
  Server Side Routing - While routing, pages comes from Server by making server call to get page.

5. <Outlet /> -> Its a component from ReactRouterDom, It contain the  component to which current child route is targeted.
Ex: If we want all component to between header and footer, then we can use this code in App.js

<Header/>
<Outlet/> -> So which ever component, the cuurent child routes target. ll be loaded here.
<Footer/>

https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/outlet

It wont load the parent route component. So we need to add the parent route also in children.

If its a nested route, then in the nested children will return in its parent outlet. So we need to add the outlet in every parent component.

Good Practice: path="about"
Bad Practice : path="/about"

6. We can nested routes using children property in Route tag of the parent route.  
 
7. Dynamic Route: It means just having ids or any route param/queryparam in URL. 
As we never know what ll be those values, so we cant hardcode it.

8. useParam hook gives params in url. This hook is from react-router-dom.

9. Object.values(objectVar) -> Its a JS function that gives an array of values of the object.
