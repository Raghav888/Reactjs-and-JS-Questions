1. window has an event "online" and "offline"  that check user is online or offline.
2. Always remove the event listner while unmounting method. and add event listner in mounting method.

3. Chunking, Code splitting, dynamic bundling, lazy loading, on demand loading, dynamic import -> all are same things.  
4. In system design interview add lazy loading, and reason why we need to add it.
In lazy loading, it creates more than one bundle file as it will load the file of that code
 when we want to show that component to user. In one single load all component wont be loaded. As lazy loaded component will be loaded on demand.

5. For optimization, we can put the images on CDN, that will reduce image load time.

6. const componentName = React.lazy(=>import ('./path to components'));
 
7. Components that will be lazy loaded needs to be wrapped in <Suspense></Suspense> in route. Imported form react.
Because that will make react know that this component will be lazy loaded and it will wait until it is loaded.
Also it takes one prop fallback, we will send a shimmer through it. So until component is rendered that shimmer willbe shown to user.

 <Suspense fallback={componentName}
>
<Component/>
</Suspense>

If we dont wrap it inside Suspense, it will give error in console and take user to error page through route.
