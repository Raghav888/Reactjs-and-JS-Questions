1. Tree shaking means removing unwanted code.
That can be unused functions that we get from librray.

2. How JSX works? JSX uses React.createElement, then that gives object and that genrates HTML code in DOM.
Babel converts JSX to React.createElement

3. {} and  {{}} in jsx. first {} says content inside it is js and second {{}} says it contains object.
