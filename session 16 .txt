1. API polling- making BE calls in a particular interval to get data. Order of data is not fix. Ex: YTB Live Chat

2. Web socket- A Bi-Directional call between UI and BE. BE send constiusly data when connection is made. Here is order of data is maintained
Only in starting UI makes a BE call then connection is made then BE send continously data. Ex: Stock market website.

3.In YTB, the ive chat, it keeps max 240 chats only nad delete it when it goes above it.

4. useMemo hook caches the result between re-render. It means in rerender the value wont be lost.
In every rerender all logic is re calculated like m  ultiplication, etc.
But if the logic is n useMemo and rerenderhappens but its depenency array is not changed, it wont run the logic that inside useMemo.
It is helpful optimization

5. React rerendes everything when any state, prop changes. That causes optimixation issues as un necessary tings are also re-rendered.
But such scenarios useMemo and useCallBcak hooks are useful. As they wont run in those rerender. They run only when there dependency array value is chnaged.

6. useCallBcak caches the function not value

7. useRef hook has a value that is not needed for rerendering. So basically rerendering doesnot happen when useRef value is changed.
And also its value is not changed when re-rerendering happens. It maintains the state value in rerendering.
